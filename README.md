# VRDriver for Desktop
This driver is made for VRChat users forced to play on desktop mode.  
By using this with my [other tool](https://github.com/watosar/PyARController), you can move your arm.

### How to use
1. build projects: VRDriverForDesktop and VRDriverForDesktop_ClientApp.
2. run vrpathreg.exe addriver ".\Driver\product\forDesktop"
3. start steamvr and make bindings for vrchat
4. run Client.exe and then run a script on your iphone.

### KeyBindings
- mouse mid: toggle functions of cursor lock and head rotation
- Home: reset positions
- End: reset controllers center positions
- arrows: move xz
- page up/down: move y
